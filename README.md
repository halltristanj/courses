# Courses
I'm always striving to increase my knowledge in programming languages I know or would like to know more about. This repo holds code from my classes I am taking (or have taken) on Udemy/other platforms.

This is not an exhaustive list of languages/techs/platforms I know. This is just a repo for course material. Please refer to my [resume](Hall_Resume_Software_Engineer.pdf) for updated information. 

Note: This is mixed code between what is provided in the course and what I have added.
