# Courses
I'm always striving to increase my knowledge in programming languages I know or would like to know more about.  
This repo holds code from my classes I am taking (or have taken) on Udemy/other platforms.

This is not an exhaustive list of languages/techs/platforms I know.  
This is just a repo for course material. Please refer to my [resume](Hall_Resume_Software_Engineer.pdf) for updated information.

Note: This is mixed code between what is provided in the course and what I have added.

## [`algorithms`](https://github.com/halltristanj/courses_and_education/tree/master/algorithms)
Common algorithms that I've written personally from scratch for practice.
