Code/etc for my lessons in Computer Science 101: Master the Theory Behind Programming by Kurt Anderson on Udemy.

This class should help me furhter understand CS concepts from lists to heaps, trees, and various sorting algorithms. 

I've enrolled in this to gain another perspective on these materials.
