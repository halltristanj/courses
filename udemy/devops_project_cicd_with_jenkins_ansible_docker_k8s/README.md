Code for my lessons on DevOps Project: CI/CD with Jenkins Ansible Docker Kubernetes by AR Shankar on Udemy.

While I have worked extensively with Jenkins and CI/CD pipelines that include Git and Docker, I have not 
built a Pipeline from scratch. This tutorial will teach me the end-to-end process.

This tutorial requires a repo of its own. I have created a private repo for development/educational purposes.
Contact me if you'd like to see it.

This tutorial gives me exposure to:
- AWS
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Maven (new for me)
- Kubernetes (new for me)
- Tomcat (new for me)
- Ansible
